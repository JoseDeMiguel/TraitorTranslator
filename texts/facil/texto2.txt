Cats are one of the most popular pets in the world. They are small, furry mammals known for their playful yet independent nature. Domestic cats are part of the feline family, and although they can hunt and catch small animals like mice and birds, many cats enjoy living with humans in a home. Cats communicate through different vocalizations, including meowing, purring, and hissing. They also use body language to express their feelings, such as arching their back when scared or wagging their tail when excited. Cats spend a large part of their day grooming themselves, licking their fur to keep it clean and free of parasites. Their sharp claws allow them to climb trees and defend themselves from predators. Though some cats love to cuddle and spend time with their owners, others prefer to be left alone. Each cat has its own unique personality and preferences.
