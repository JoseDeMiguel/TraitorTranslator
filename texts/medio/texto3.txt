The human heart is a vital organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It is about the size of a fist and located in the chest, slightly to the left of the sternum. The heart is divided into four chambers: two atria at the top and two ventricles at the bottom. Blood flows through the heart in a specific order: oxygen-poor blood enters the right atrium, is pumped into the right ventricle, and then sent to the lungs to be oxygenated. Once the blood is oxygen-rich, it returns to the left atrium, flows into the left ventricle, and is pumped out to the rest of the body. The heart's pumping action is controlled by electrical impulses that trigger the heartbeat. This rhythmic action ensures that blood circulates properly to all organs and tissues. The heart also plays a role in regulating blood pressure, which is necessary for proper circulation. A healthy heart is essential for overall well-being, and lifestyle choices such as exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding smoking can help keep the heart functioning optimally.
